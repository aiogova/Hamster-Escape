# Hamster Escape

## Overview
This is a project I made in my creative coding class. 

In this creative coding project, I developed an interactive game titled "Hamster Escape". I made this project using mainly JavaScript and the p5.js JavaScript library, but a little bit of HTML and CSS was also used. Inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird, in this game, you control a hamster trying to escape from a cat by dodging moving cat paws. The game incorporates Perlin noise to create a natural, flowing movement for the cat paws, which adds a unique touch to the gameplay by ensuring that their movement feels random yet smooth.
