# Hamster Escape

## Overview
This is a project I made in my Creative Coding class. 

In this creative coding project, I developed an interactive game titled "Hamster Escape". I made this project using mainly JavaScript and the p5.js JavaScript library, but a little bit of HTML and CSS was also used. Inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird, in this game, you control a hamster trying to escape from a cat by dodging moving cat paws. The game incorporates Perlin noise to create a natural, flowing movement for the cat paws, which adds a unique touch to the gameplay by ensuring that their movement feels random yet smooth.

## Usage Instructions
At the start of the game, you are prompted to enter the number of points you aim to get. Each time you make it past a cat paw, you gain a point. Each time you get caught by a cat paw, you lose a point. If you manage to beat your desired score, you win! If you lose all your points, you lose.

The controls of the game are as follows:

Up = Spacebar

Down = Release spacebar

Acceleration mode (makes the hamster go up/down faster) = Shift (press to toggle it on/off)
