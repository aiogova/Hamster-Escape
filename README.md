# Hamster Escape - Creative Coding Project

## Overview
This is a project I made in my Creative Coding class. 

In this creative coding project, I developed an interactive game titled "Hamster Escape". I made this project using mainly JavaScript and the p5.js JavaScript library, but a little bit of HTML and CSS was also used. Inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird, in this game, you control a hamster trying to escape from a cat by dodging moving cat paws. The game incorporates Perlin noise to create a natural, flowing movement for the cat paws, which adds a unique touch to the gameplay by ensuring that their movement feels random yet smooth.

## Usage Instructions
At the start of the game, you are prompted to enter the number of points you aim to get. Each time you make it past a cat paw, you gain a point. Each time you get caught by a cat paw, you lose a point. If you manage to beat your desired score, you win! If you lose all your points, you lose.

The controls of the game are as follows:

Up = Spacebar

Down = Release spacebar

Acceleration mode (makes the hamster go up/down faster) = Shift (press to toggle it on/off)

## Installation Instructions
There is no server-side programming in this project, so this site can be hosted on any platform that accommodates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In other words, this project is entirely frontend. It consists of static files. There is no backend code, so this project doesn't need anything to run except a web browser. Any hosting service that can serve static files will work. So there is nothing to really "install" here in a traditional sense.

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed directly in a web browser. The link in the "Usage Instructions" leads to that.
